Sorting is probably the most common computer science algorithm. In fact, at some point in life, every CS student studied computational complexity based on the number of operations of different sorting algorithms, measured by the [Big-O notation][bigo]. Sorting of serial algorithms in single compute nodes is a solved problem with dozens of algorithms analyzed. To name a few:
